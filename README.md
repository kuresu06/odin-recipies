Task: to put my miniscule HTML experience to practice.

Tools: My tiny brain and my big computer.

Thesis: I will have to look up guides every 5 minutes.

Result: Only needed to look up guides two times. I put way too much effort for such a simple website, but it went smooth and great. 

Conclusion: I should trust my brain more.
