    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Simple and easy to make dish, comprised of spaghetti, minced meat, sauce and, of course, cheese, if that suits your taste.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion<em> finely chopped</em></li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oreagano</li>
        <li>28 ounces crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic <em>chopped</em></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 good sized handful fresh parsley <em>chopped</em> </li>
        <li>Salt and pepper <em>to taste</em></li>
        <li>½ pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>Grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese for serving <em>optional</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté until lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and fry another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef; fry until fully cooked and no pink shows at all in the meat (about 8 minutes). Add the oregano and tomato paste and mix with the meat.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, parsley, and bring to a boil. Season with the salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to low, and cook for at least 15 minutes (you can cook longer for a deeper flavor).</li>
        <li>In the meantime, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. Drain and serve topped with the sauce and cheese (if using).</li>
    </ol>
